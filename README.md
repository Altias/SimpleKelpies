# SimpleKelpies-1.19.3

Simple Kelpies, as the name suggests, adds kelpies to Minecraft!

Kelpies are mythical beings, said to take the form of (usually white) horses in order to lure people onto their backs so they can take them into the water and drown/eat them. 

The mod adds kelpies in the form of white horses that can be found on beaches, near rivers, or near oceans. Should you try and ride one, they'll do exactly what the myth says and gallop off towards the water with you to kill you. Be careful, a kelpie in the water is a lot stronger than a kelpie on land!

Should you choose, you can tame a kelpie of your own! Plenty of stories say that if you bridle a kelpie, it becomes tame. Find the rare golden bridle in a dungeon (rare), shipwreck (less rare), or underwater ruin (common) and you can see for yourself! A tamed kelpie is faster and can jump higher than your average horse. They'll eat any meat, salmon, or cod, that you offer them if you need to heal them.

As of now, kelpies can't be bred.
